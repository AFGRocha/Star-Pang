# Star Pang
Star Pang is a college project made for the Graphic Animation class.
The objective of said project was to create a clone of the game Pang with the knowledge adquired from the class using HTLM5 Canvas.

With that in mind I decided to use Star Fox characters on my project, and with that Star Pang was born
